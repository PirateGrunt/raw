The `raw` package includes several other packages which are of general interest to actuaries. These packages each come with various data sets.

`raw` itself comes with several data sets of its own. These are:

#### COTOR - Committee on the Theory of Risk

These are four data sets- COTOR2, COTOR3, COTOR4, COTOR5 which have simulated loss amounts. COTOR2 and COTOR3 are simply vectors with losses. COTOR4 adds a claim number and year. COTOR5 has a risk code, year and geographical indicator.

#### Hurricane
