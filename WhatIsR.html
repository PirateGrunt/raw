		<h1>What is R?</h1>
		<p>R is a programming language, derived from S. It is an "open source" project, which means that its license entitles anyone to use the software, so long as they keep their use of the software "open". The specific licensing language may be found here: <a href=http://www.r-project.org/COPYING>http://www.r-project.org/COPYING</a>. The practical consequence of an open source project is that- similar to something like Wikipedia- users may contribute improvements and extensions to the project.</p>
			
		<p>Information about R may be found at <a href=http://www.r-project.org/>http://www.r-project.org/</a>. Another great source for inspiration is <a href=http://www.r-bloggers.com/>http://www.r-bloggers.com/</a>. Here, you'll see examples where R has been applied in dozens of different contexts. This is an 
		aggregation of blogs from around the world and changes every day. It's always worth checking out. There are at least two R-focused blogs written by actuaries.
		The first is <a href=http://lamages.blogspot.com/>http://lamages.blogspot.com/</a> written by Markus Gesman in London. Markus works for Lloyds and is the 
		original author of the ChainLadder package in R. Another, <a href=http://pirategrunt.com/>http://pirategrunt.com/</a>, is written by me. This is where I write about stuff that interests me in a format where I needn't worry quite so much about how polished the verbiage and analysis is. I'll give the standard caveat that the views expressed on my blog do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, the CAS or anyone other than me.
